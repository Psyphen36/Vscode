Creating database Tables through python.
So far, we used 'emptab' table that was already created in the MySQL database.
It is also possible to create any table in the MySQL database using a python program.
Once the table is created, we can insert the rows through a python program.
Suppose we want to create emptab table with the columns: eno, ename, sex and salary,
we can write a SQL command as follows:
create table emptab(enoint, ename char(20), sex char(1), salary float)

Before the emptab is created, we can check if any table already exists by
 that name is the database and we can delete that table using drop table command as:
drop table if exists emptab

The command should be first executed and after that, we can create the new emptab table.
